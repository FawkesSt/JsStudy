###### How to insert Javascript in a HTML file

We use the `<script>` tag to load the Javascript file to our HTML document, this tag must come inside the body tag and preferably be the last item to avoid problems with the code.

The final code will be something like this `<script src="./yourjsfile.js"></script>`, the SRC attribute specifies the URL of an external script file. You can also write code directly inside the script tag, but it is not recommended for large blocks of code.
