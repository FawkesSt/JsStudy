const user = {
    name: "Matheus",
    age: 24,
    married: false,
    products: ["Cell", "Computer", "Videogame"]
}

user.age; // Access the age inside the user object

//To access a value inside an array in a object use:

user.products[0]; // This example access the first value of the array witch is "Cell" (I discoverd this by my self and I am very proud :) )
